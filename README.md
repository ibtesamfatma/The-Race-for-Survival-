INTRODUCTION:
India is slowly turning into a start-up hub. According to the National Association of Software and Services Companies, India saw a 108 percent growth in total funding from USD two billion in 2017 to USD 4.2 billion in 2018. Industry leaders consider India the third largest technology startup ecosystem in the world. In 2015 alone, three to four startups on an average started every day. Hence, to keep up with the modern times, it becomes important to understand the term “start-up”.
A start-up venture can be described as a new business where entrepreneurs aim to be their own boss and launch their market fit business model. In simple language, a start-up is defined as an organization which:


•	engages in development, production or distribution of new products, processes or services
•	has been federated for three years or less 
•	has a revenue of up to INR 25 crores
•	employs 50 people or less

There are four kinds of market structures into which a new start-up can venture. 


1. Existing Market- This is a type of market structure in which the information related to the buyers and competitors is already known. 
2. New Market- A new market is created when the product offered by the start-up enables its customers to do something which was not possible before the product was presented in the company. There is no knowledge about the customers or the direct competitors of the product in the market. 
3. Re-segmentation of an existing market as a low-cost player- Start-ups present an already existing product in the market but the quality of the new product is inferior as compared to the original product. As a result of this, the price of the new product is lesser as compared to the original product. This gives the start-up an edge over its competitors. 
4. Re-segmentation of an existing market by employing niche strategies- If the start-up identifies a part of the market which can be captured through a more focused solution, then a niche strategy is viable for the start-up. 


After the selection of the kind of market structure into which the start-up might enter, the next important step is to get the necessary funding for the start-up.
•	Friends and Family- A lot of start-ups get their first funding from friends and family. For example- After the founders of Excite graduated from college, they borrowed $15000 from their parents to start a company.

•	Consulting- Another way to fund a start-up is to get a job in a consulting project in which the founder can build the software that he wanted to make as a start-up. Then he can gradually transform himself from a consulting company to a product company and have the clients pay for the development expenses.

•	Angel Investors- ‘Angel’ refers to a rich individual. Angel investors usually give monetary support to the start-ups in the initial stages. 

•	Seed Funding Firms- Seed funding firms are companies that invest relatively small amounts of money in the initial stages of the business. It is comparatively easier to approach seed funding firms since they are companies and not individuals, as in the case of angel investors. 

•	Venture Capital Funds- Venture Capital Funds invest money collected from other individuals into promising start-ups. They invest huge amounts of money but it is not easy to impress these investors.

Start-ups face high uncertainty and have high rates of failure. Infrastructure, government regulations and availability of finance at different stages of growth are some of the hurdles that start-ups face. This paper aims to discuss a few challenges that an Indian startup has to face and spread awareness about the government policies that can provide help in the current start-up ecosystem.



OBJECTIVES:
•	To understand the type of market structure that is targeted by start-ups in a metropolitan city like Bengaluru.

•	To analyze the type of funding received by start-ups in the domain in which the start-up operates.

•	To spread and gather information about the benefits of various government schemes that help incubate and run start-ups.

•	To study the spending behavior of start-ups in various fields like research and development, marketing and administrative activities.

•	To study the socioeconomic background of individual in the initial stage of start-ups.

LITERATURE REVIEW:
Going by a report submitted by the UN, it was found out that over 350 million youths who belong to the age group of 10-24 years were the ones who tend to be the leading force behind innovation and invention of ideas along with a great understanding of the right balance between demand and consumption of goods and services (Mittal, 2014)[1] 
In a study done by Dr. Gopaldas Pawan Kumar (2018)[2], various problems and challenges faced by Indian start-ups are brought to light. According to Dr. Gopaldas, before starting off with the start-up venture, it is of at most importance to understand the market size, profit areas, revenue and also keeping in mind some of the most basic elements of a successful start-up like time, tenacity and team work. 
Thomas Hillmann and Manju Puri (2000)[3]inspected the extent to which the venture capitalists had an impact on the growth and development of new firms. Their study indicates the presence of a soft facet to VCs when speaking of providing support to companies to establish their Human Resource within the organization. 
Paul Graham[4], in one of his articles, says that a start-up is meant to be agile in terms of growth. It is not enough to be newly founded unless the idea brings about tangible outputs and change in the current trends with great speed.
